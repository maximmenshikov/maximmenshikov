### Hi there!

I am Maxim Menshikov, a researcher & software engineer living in St. Petersburg, Russia. My passion is developing a static analysis framework and all the infrastructure around it. Besides that, I have spent many years in reverse engineering (with a minor part of results presented in @ultrashot account).

Today, my mission is to improve static analysis experience. Follow me for the updates on that direction!
