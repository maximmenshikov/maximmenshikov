## Hi there!

I am **Maxim Menshikov**, a static analysis researcher and CEO of [@interpretica-io](https://github.com/interpretica-io). My passion is developing a static analysis framework and all the infrastructure around it.

Today, my mission is to improve static analysis experience. Follow me for the updates on that direction!
